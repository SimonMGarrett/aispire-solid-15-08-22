# Notes

- Don't start this with `yarn dev` because we need to start Netlify functions, so we do that with `netlify dev` instead.

- All original images are in /.site-construction/images. This is where I'm putting stuff that's not actually on the site
  directly, but which I want to keep with/alongside the site.

- All 'main image' images that appear at the top of the blog posts should be 3:2 ratio.
