GENERAL:
  - asdfasdf

Visuals:
- random number of circles
- each pulses randomly between quite small and fairly big, those nearer the edge (see below for placement) tend to be smaller.
- each has a color that stays the same in the range blue green to bluey-purple.
- each randomly choose a spot a gaussian distance from its center and translates to that point with ease-in-out.
- each is given its center spot a gaussian distance from the center of the screen.

☐ The visuals could be underneath everythign, but that sounds like it might just get confusing, so it's more likely that they would be part of a display, like
- a hero image or something.

☐ All the site does is get attention visually, and boast about how good I am and how you should want to hire me to do data management (like GJU), data cleaning
- data science, AI, ML etc.
